# Short introduction to the Generalized Extreme Values (GEV) distribution
The GEV distribution is calculated with and without the Matlab statistical toolbox for wind data


## Summary

J. W. Holmes proposes an introduction to the Generalized Extreme Values (GEV) distribution, with application for extreme wind velocities in his book: "Wind loading of structures" [1]. The present submision reproduces some the examples given in [1], with and without the Matlab statistics toolbox [2].

## Content

The present submission contains:

  • 2 functions fitGEV.m and mygevcdf.m
  
  • One Matlab Livescript file Documentation.mlx, which reproduces some of the results given in [1]
  
  • One .mat file EastSale.m
